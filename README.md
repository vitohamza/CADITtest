# CADITtest

I use Python and Jupyter notebook for my code. I've successfully created the output of test 1 & 2 but I kind of struggling with how to integrate real data stream in test 3 so I am using known data which sent to me before. Although I'm not completing all the test, it is indeed a fun coding challenge.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Regards,
Vito
